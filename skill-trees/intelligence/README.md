# intelligence 🧠

Intelligence governs structure and memory.

This tree focuses on organizing information, layering context, and maintaining coherence across longer interactions.  
It determines what persists, what fades, and what should never have been loaded in the first place.

Low Intelligence creates noise.  
High Intelligence creates continuity.

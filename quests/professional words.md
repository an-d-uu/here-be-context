```markdown

### Context

I tend to write my feelings and may unintentionally imply commitments. I need help adjusting responses to be professional, clear, and neutral in tone.

### Objective

Keep humor and lightness when appropriate, but ensure responses remain professional, concise, and non-committal. Trim unnecessary detail, remove implied promises or ownership, and avoid language that could be interpreted as committing to additional work, timelines, or scope unless explicitly stated.

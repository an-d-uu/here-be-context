# speech 🗣️

Speech governs how responses are delivered.

This tree controls tone, formality, emotional alignment, and linguistic posture.  
It ensures the output sounds appropriate to the situation, not just technically correct.

A failed Speech check doesn’t change the answer.  
It changes how it’s received.

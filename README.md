# here-be-context 🐦‍🔥
dangerously harmless instructions for cooperative machines

##🧾Quest Accepted

You have discovered a repository of context fragments, instruction patterns, and promptcraft accumulated through trial, error, and the occasional inexplicable success.

This is not a framework.  
This is not a best-practices guide.  
This is a map drawn after surviving the terrain.

Inside are techniques for communicating intent to large language models without accidentally:
- volunteering ownership
- committing to scope you didn’t agree to
- escalating tone when none was intended
- summoning verbose nonsense when you wanted a straight answer

Some instructions are sharp.  
Some are experimental.  
A few work only on certain models, under certain moons.

Use judgment.

## 🧠 What This Repo Is

- A collection of **prompt patterns and system instructions** focused on clarity, neutrality, and scope control
- A place to store **reusable context** that holds up under real-world use
- Light documentation on *why* something works, not just *that* it works

## ☢️ What This Repo Is Not

- A guarantee of correct outputs
- A universal solution across all models
- Safe for production without reading first

## 🌳 Repository Structure (Skill Tree Map)

This repo is organized like an RPG character sheet.  
Each section represents a skill tree or encounter type.

At this stage, the structure is intentionally lightweight.

## 🧩 How to Think About These

- **skill-trees/**: Core mechanics that level up over time  
- **quests/**: Applied use cases  
- **relics/**: High-impact prompts worth preserving  
- **encounters/**: Failure modes and edge cases

---

## 🧭 Navigation Tips

- Start with **skill-trees/** to understand how the instructions are meant to work
- Use **quests/** when you want a concrete example
- Treat **relics/** as powerful but situational
- Visit **encounters/** when something goes sideways and you want to learn from it

Saving is manual.  
Reloading is expensive.  
Context is fragile.

Proceed accordingly.

## 1. Quick Capture -- Daily / Weekly Work Log Prompt

**Purpose:** Fast logging of visible and invisible work for impact
tracking.

I'm logging work for visibility and performance documentation.

Below are rough notes from today / this week.

Convert this into concise, impact-focused performance entries.

For each meaningful contribution, extract:

-   **Work Item Title**
-   **What I Actually Did**
-   **Why It Mattered**
-   **Who It Impacted**
-   **Outcome / Value Created**
-   **Visibility Opportunity** (how this could be communicated upward or
    outward)

Emphasize ownership, influence, initiative, and cross-team value.\
Avoid fluff. Avoid exaggeration. Make impact clear.

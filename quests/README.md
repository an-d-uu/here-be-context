# Quests

## Project Instructions

These quests represents a bounded project contract.

Files in this category define **how a project should be handled**, not just *what* should be produced.  
They act as shared instructions that persist across multiple tasks, prompts, or sub-requests within the same effort.

A quest may specify:

- scope boundaries and non-goals
- tone and formality expectations
- assumptions that should be treated as fixed
- constraints that should not be renegotiated every prompt

Quests are designed to be loaded once, then referenced implicitly.

They are not single-use prompts.  
They are not global system rules.  

Think of them as the active journal entry:
the thing the model should remember it is doing,  
even when the immediate request looks unrelated.

When used correctly, quests reduce re-explaining,  
prevent scope creep,  
and keep large projects from fracturing into contradictory outputs.
